# Bridge-Analysis
This MATLAB project was completed as part of the CIV102 Civil Engineering Bridge Project. It performs a detailed structural analysis of a bridge subjected to train loading. The project demonstrates fundamental principles of structural analysis and design, including shear force, bending moment calculations, and factor of safety (FOS).
